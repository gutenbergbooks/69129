<p class="ph2">THE STORY OF A<br>
SAWDUST DOLL</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<span class="small">FUN IN TOY TOWN</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Toy Town</span> was not a little city off by itself
on the shore of some winding river.
Nor was Toy Town a place up near the
North Pole, where Santa Claus has his
workshops for making presents. The Toy
Town I am going to tell you about was in
a big store. To get to it you went up in
an elevator, and, once you were there, you
saw the most wonderful and beautiful
things you ever dreamed of! There were
all sorts of toys, drums that beat a rub-a-dub-dub<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
all by themselves, funny clowns
who banged tinkly brass things together
when you pushed a spring near their neckties,
and many other fascinating playthings.</p>

<p>Toy Town was a wonderful place!</p>

<p>One night, when the elevators had
stopped sliding up and down, and when
the doors of the big store were closed, and
when the lights had been turned low, there
was a rattling, a clattering, a rustling and
bustling and a whispering and talking on
the shelves and counters of Toy Town.</p>

<p>“Has everybody gone?” asked a Sawdust
Doll, as she sat stiffly up near a Bold
Tin Soldier, whose sword shone faintly in
the light of one little electric lamp. The
Sawdust Doll was stiff because she had
been lying on her back all day.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think every one has gone,” answered
a White Rocking Horse, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
moved slowly to and fro on the floor, just
under the toy counter. He was too large
to be put up on the shelf. Besides, he
might accidentally have kicked a hole in
the drum. Mind you! I’m not saying he
would have done it on purpose, but he
might have done it by accident.</p>

<p>“I don’t see any one,” said the Bold Tin
Soldier, and he waved his sword over his
head.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he just wonderful!” whispered
the Candy Rabbit to the Calico Clown. “I
wish I were as brave as he! If any one
has stayed behind in Toy Town to try to
watch what we do after store hours, I’m
sure they’ll be glad enough to run away
when they see the sword of the Tin Soldier.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is a bold chap,” answered the
Calico Clown, and he felt the least bit jealous
because the Candy Rabbit thought the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
Tin Soldier chap was so fine. “I always
wanted to be a soldier,” went on the Calico
Clown, “but when I was small I began
playing tricks and making jokes, so—look
what I am!” and he held out his two long
arms, on the end of each of which was a
round, shiny piece of brass. These brasses
were called “cymbals,” and they tinkled
together with a clanging sound. “No use
for me to wish to be a soldier,” sighed the
Calico Clown. “My life is a joke!”</p>

<p>“I like you best as you are. You’re real
jolly, I think,” chattered a Monkey on a
Stick, as he climbed up and then climbed
down again. “We must have some fun in
this world, as well as being guarded by Tin
Soldiers.”</p>

<p>“That is very true,” remarked a Lamb
on Wheels, as she rolled over toward the
White Rocking Horse. “I love jolly times.
That’s why I’m always so glad when night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
comes and we toys may do as we please.”</p>

<p>“We may, if there is no one to watch
us,” said the Sawdust Doll, as she got up
on her feet, rather stiffly, for, as I have
said, she had been lying on her back all
day, and you know how tiresome that is.
“But we must be very careful not to start
our fun until every one is away,” went on
the Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>“I’ll take a look,” offered the Bold Tin
Soldier.</p>

<p>“I’ll come with you,” said the Calico
Clown. “If we find that any boys or girls,
or their fathers or mothers, have hidden
themselves away in our Toy Town, to spy
on us at our play, I’ll bang my cymbals together.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll shout and wave my sword,”
went on the Tin Soldier.</p>

<p>“Surely that ought to scare them away,”
bleated the Lamb on Wheels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>“If it doesn’t, I’ll just gallop toward
them,” said the White Rocking Horse.
“That will make them run!”</p>

<p>So the Bold Tin Soldier and the Calico
Clown climbed down off the toy counter
and walked slowly, and a little stiffly,
over the floor toward the elevators. The
one light shone dimly, and by its rays they
could see that no one was in the store—not
even the watchman. He was down on
the first floor, near the perfumery counter.
He loved the smell of perfumery, did
that watchman.</p>

<p>“No one is here!” said the Bold Tin Soldier,
as he came marching back with the
Calico Clown.</p>

<p>“Not a soul to watch us? That’s fine!”
shouted the Monkey on a Stick. “Now I’m
going to have some fun!” and he began to
run up and down so quickly that the Sawdust
Doll cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>“Oh, please, Monkey! Not so fast, if
you please! You make me dizzy!”</p>

<p>“All right! I’ll go more slowly,” kindly
offered the Monkey. “But when you’ve
had to keep still all day, because so many
boys and girls are watching you, when
they’re not picking you up and punching
you to see what you’re made of—I say
when you’ve been that way all day, you
want to go fast when you get the chance.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” agreed the White Rocking
Horse. “I feel like kicking my heels,
too.”</p>

<p>“Well, just wait a moment, if you
please,” put in the Bold Tin Soldier. “I
want to march some of my men out into
the middle of the floor and have a little
parade. After I get them past you, why,
then you may kick up your heels as much
as you please.”</p>

<p>“All right,” whinnied the White Horse.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
“March away! I’m glad to do a favor.”</p>

<p>The Bold Tin Soldier nimbly jumped
up on the counter, where he had been
standing all day in a box with his tin soldier
men. He waved his sword over his
head until it flashed in the gleam of the
one light like a star on a frosty night, and
the Sawdust Doll covered her eyes with
her hand, because it was so shiny.</p>

<p>“Attention, soldiers!” cried the tin captain.</p>

<p>Every one of the tin soldiers in the box
sprang up straight and stiff and held his
gun to his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Forward—march!” cried the captain,
again waving his sword.</p>

<p>The tin soldiers stepped into line behind
him, and, one after another, they followed
him as he jumped off the counter to the
floor. Past the White Rocking Horse they
marched, each one as brave as his captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“Now you may kick your heels as high
as you please, Mr. White Rocking Horse,”
called the captain. “We are safely out of
your reach.”</p>

<p>“All right!” came the answer. “Here
I go!” And with that the toy horse, which
was built to make some boy happy, began
rocking to and fro.</p>

<p>“If any one wants a ride on my back,
now’s his chance!” called the White Rocking
Horse.</p>

<p>“I do!” cried the Sawdust Doll, and
with the help of the Calico Clown she got
down off the counter and climbed up and
sat on the saddle.</p>

<p>And, for a few moments, all that could
be heard in Toy Town was the faint sound
of the marching feet of the tin soldiers,
the rumble of the Rocking Horse and the
tinkle of the Calico Clown’s cymbals.</p>

<p>It was close to midnight now—the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
when all toys are allowed to do as they
please, provided no one sees them. No
one must ever look at, or watch, the toys
at their play. In fact, no one has ever
seen them having fun after dark in the
big stores.</p>

<p>And the reason for that is this:</p>

<p>When the toys were given the power of
coming to life, of talking, moving about,
having fun, and behaving just as they
would if they were real folk—when they
were given this power there was just one
thing they were told, and that was:</p>

<p>“No one must ever see you moving
about!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Of course not!” said all the
toys.</p>

<p>And so, from the very beginning, no one
has ever seen the toys at play. Just the
very moment the eyes of a boy or a girl,
or a daddy or a mother, or even an uncle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
or an aunt, lights on one of the toys, that
toy just becomes as still as anything.</p>

<p>If, by some chance, when you weren’t
looking a Sawdust Doll should start to
dance with a Calico Clown, and you should
turn your eyes toward them, they would
stop at once, and you’d never know but
what they had been motionless all their
lives.</p>

<p>Because of this no one has ever seen the
toys at play, and the only reason I am allowed
to tell you what they did is because
I promised not to look. They told me
about it afterward—just how it all happened—and
that’s why I may put it in a
book. But as for looking myself at the
toys as they play, or letting any one else
look—never! I wouldn’t dream of it!</p>

<p>“Am I going too fast for you?” politely
asked the White Rocking Horse of the
Sawdust Doll, as he rode her on his back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>“Oh, not at all,” she answered. “I like
it.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” he replied. “Oh, look
at the Monkey, will you?” he called.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he funny?” said the Sawdust
Doll. “Do you know, he’ll make some little
boy or girl laugh, I’m sure of it!”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’ll be a nice Christmas toy for
some one,” answered the Horse.</p>

<p>“But I would like to stay here among
my toy friends a little longer,” said the
Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is nice here,” said the Calico
Clown, as he softly banged his cymbals.
“Say, let’s have a little party!” he went
on. “It is getting close to Christmas now.
Some of us are sure to be bought and taken
away. Some of us may never see the
others again. We ought to celebrate in
some way.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I say!” came from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
Candy Rabbit. “Of course, I’m not so
likely to go until near Easter time. But
you never can tell. Let’s have a party, I
say,” and the Candy Rabbit wiggled his
ears.</p>

<p>“A good idea!” bleated the Lamb on
Wheels. “What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“We could play tag!” said the Monkey
on a Stick.</p>

<p>“You can beat us all at that,” remarked
the Sawdust Doll. “You jump around so
I never can tag you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go slowly this time,” promised the
Monkey. “Come on—let’s have a game of
tag!”</p>

<p>“Or hide-and-go-seek!” said the Calico
Clown. “I know a dandy place to hide,”
he whispered to the Candy Rabbit.
“There’s a hole in the counter near the
Jack-in-the-Box, and he won’t tell where
we are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“Is there room for me?” asked the
Candy Rabbit.</p>

<p>“Plenty,” answered the Calico Clown.
“Come on!”</p>

<p>The Sawdust Doll was just getting off
the White Rocking Horse to join in the
fun when, all at once, the Candy Rabbit
cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, some one is coming! Some one is
coming! Quiet, everybody! Don’t move!”</p>

<p>And as each and every toy stiffened out,
to look as unlifelike as possible, a scratching,
squeaking noise was heard all through
Toy Town.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<span class="small">JUST WAITING</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear</span> me! What is it? What can it
be?” whispered the Sawdust Doll to the
White Rocking Horse.</p>

<p>“Hush! Quiet! Don’t say a word,”
the Horse whispered back. “If it’s the
watchman, or any people coming back after
something they have forgotten, they
must never know that we can move about
and have fun when they aren’t looking.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Of course not!” agreed the
Sawdust Doll, in a whisper, and then she
sat very quietly on the back of the Rocking
Horse, for she had no chance, so suddenly
had the alarming noise sounded, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
get back to her place on the toy counter.</p>

<p>Pitter and patter, squeak and bang,
rattle and rustle went the noise that had
so frightened all the toy friends who were
just getting ready for a party.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the Lamb on
Wheels.</p>

<p>“Is it the watchman?” the Monkey on
a Stick wanted to know. He had crouched
down near a toy fire engine, and he was
wishing he might shower some water on a
stuffed elephant near by.</p>

<p>“Or is it some of the shoppers who have
forgotten some toy they bought during the
day?” asked the Candy Rabbit.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, the Sawdust
Doll, looking down at the floor, cried
out:</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a rat! It’s a great big rat!
Oh! Oh-e-e-e-e-e!” and she squealed like
the little Green Pig on the top shelf, only,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
as he was asleep just then, he didn’t do
any squealing himself.</p>

<p>“Gracious! I hope he doesn’t nibble
off one of my ears,” said the Candy Rabbit,
and he tried to hide behind the Calico
Clown, who had managed to get back to
his place on the counter.</p>

<p>“Forward, march! Take aim! Charge
bayonets,” a voice suddenly called
through the dim darkness of the toy store.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s the Bold Tin Soldier!” cried
the Sawdust Doll. “Oh, protect us! Save
us from the rat!” she begged.</p>

<p>“Of course I will!” the Tin Soldier answered.
“Where is he? Let me and my
men get at him!”</p>

<p>“Here he is! Right over by the White
Rocking Horse!” answered the Sawdust
Doll.</p>

<p>“Squeak! Squeak!” went the rat.
“What’s all the trouble here? Can’t a fellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
look for something to eat without having
such a fuss made over it? What’s the
matter?”</p>

<p>“Matter enough!” exclaimed the Bold
Tin Soldier, marching up with his tin
men. “It’s true you are not a boy or a
girl or a grown person; so we aren’t afraid
to have you see us in motion. But you
must get out of here!”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked the rat, and he
looked hungrily at the ears of the Candy
Rabbit. The rat was very fond of sweet
things. “Why must I run away?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Because you don’t belong here,” answered
the Tin Soldier. “Your place is
down in the cellar near the coal bin and
the furnace. This is the toy department.
There is nothing to eat here, and we are
going to have a party.”</p>

<p>“How can you have a party without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
something to eat?” asked the rat, with a
cunning look, for these creatures are very
sly.</p>

<p>“It isn’t going to be that kind of party
at all,” said the Sawdust Doll. She felt
rather safe up on the back of the White
Rocking Horse. “We’re just going to
play tag, and do things like that,” she went
on.</p>

<p>“And not going to have anything to
eat!” exclaimed the rat. “Pooh! I don’t
call that any kind of party at all! I’m
hungry!”</p>

<p>“Then you’d better run away!” said the
Bold Tin Soldier, and he flashed his sword
so daringly, and his soldiers pointed their
tin guns and bayonets so sharply at the
rat that, after showing his teeth once or
twice, he switched his tail and ran back to
the hole by which he had gnawed his way
into Toy Town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“Well, I’m glad he’s gone,” said the
Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>“So am I,” said the Candy Rabbit.
“I am sure he wanted to see how I
tasted.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that you can blame
him,” remarked the Calico Clown. “You
surely are the sweetest thing here! Ha!
Ha! Here we are again, boys and girls!”
he cried.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a joke!” exclaimed the Sawdust
Doll.</p>

<p>“That’s it! We must have fun!”
laughed the Calico Clown. “Here is another
joke! What kind of toes never wear
any shoes?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The idea!” said the Sawdust Doll.
“There aren’t any kinds of toes but what
have shoes to cover them. My toes are
covered with kid shoes, and the Tin Soldier’s
toes are covered with tin shoes, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
the Monkey’s toes are covered with plush,
and——”</p>

<p>“I mean pota-toes!” laughed the Calico
Clown. “Ha! Ha! Ha! Pota-toes never
wear shoes!” and he doubled up in the
middle, because he thought his joke was so
funny.</p>

<p>“Well, that isn’t such a bad one,” said
the Rocking Horse. “You must have been
in a circus, Mr. Clown.”</p>

<p>“No, not yet, but I want to be,” was the
answer. “I’m hoping some boy will buy
me and put me in a sawdust ring. That’s
where I belong as a Calico Clown. In a
sawdust ring!”</p>

<p>And the Calico Clown banged his cymbals
together and felt so jolly that he sang
a little song like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“In a sawdust ring,</div>
<div class="verse">In a sawdust ring,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
<div class="verse">That’s where I belong.</div>
<div class="verse">I’ll crack a joke,</div>
<div class="verse">Some fun I’ll poke,</div>
<div class="verse">And then I’ll song a sing.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“What’s that? What’s that?” asked
the Bold Tin Soldier. “‘Song a sing’?”</p>

<p>“It’s just the same as sing a song only
I do it backwards by standing on my
head,” answered the Calico Clown.</p>

<p>“Don’t pay too much attention to him,”
whispered the Sawdust Doll. “He’s cutting
up to-night.”</p>

<p>“I should say he was!” exclaimed the
Tin Soldier. “Song a sing! The idea!
Next we know he’ll be tuning a whistle instead
of whistling a tune, and they aren’t
the same thing at all—even backwards.”</p>

<p>“Indeed not!” agreed the Sawdust Doll.
“But I’m so glad you drove that rat
away,” she added, and she looked kindly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
at the Bold Tin Soldier. “We never could
have had any fun while he was here.”</p>

<p>Then the good times began. They
played tag and hide-and-go-seek and a new
game they made up among themselves.
They called it “Jump the Jack.”</p>

<p>Each one had to take a turn jumping
over the Jack-in-the-Box, and the Jack
would reach up and try to tag them as they
leaped over his head. If he touched any
one of them, that toy had to stand on one
foot and sing a song. And they had lots
of fun when the Calico Clown was touched
by the Jack-in-the-Box, for the Clown
sang such a funny song, all backwards
with the words mixed up like pickles.</p>

<p>Of course the White Rocking Horse was
too big to get up on the counter and jump
around with the Candy Rabbit and the
Sawdust Doll, but he had fun staying on
the floor near the toy blackboard and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
watching the chalk draw funny pictures.
For not only the toys that are in the shape
of animals and persons have fun when no
one is watching them, but the others, also,
like the roller skates and the velocipedes,
have good times among themselves at these
midnight frolics.</p>

<p>And so the fun went on. The Sawdust
Doll was having a lovely time, playing on
a little toy piano for the Monkey on a
Stick to dance with the Calico Clown, and
the Candy Rabbit was listening to a
Stuffed Duck tell how she learned to swim
in the Goldfish bowl when all at once the
Tin Soldier cried:</p>

<p>“Back to your shelves and counters,
everybody!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Is the rat coming
again?” asked the Sawdust Doll, as she
stopped playing the toy piano.</p>

<p>“No, but it is getting daylight,” was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
answer. “I can see the gleam of the sun
in the eastern windows. Soon the store
will be open and people will be coming in
to buy—perhaps some one may buy me and
my brave men.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope not!” sighed the Sawdust
Doll. “If you go away, what shall we do
if the rat comes back?”</p>

<p>“Maybe I can stop up his hole before I
go away,” the Bold Tin Soldier answered.
“But quick, now! Everybody
back on shelf or counter! Here comes the
sun!”</p>

<p>And as the sun rose and filled the world
with light, the doors of Toy Town opened.
The clerks came in to dust the different
things and set them to rights, for it was
the Christmas season and many people
would come to buy.</p>

<p>“I wonder if some one will buy me,”
softly murmured the Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“Do you want them to?” asked the
Candy Rabbit.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose that is why I was put
in Toy Town,” answered the Doll. “I
want to do my duty, and make some little
girl happy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what we’re for,” laughed
the jolly Calico Clown. “It’s fun to make
boys and girls happy. I only wish I could
crack some of my jokes for them, but it
isn’t allowed. I know one about an ear of
corn and——”</p>

<p>“Hush!” whispered the Sawdust Doll.
“Here comes the girl who has charge of
our counter!”</p>

<p>Then all the toys stopped talking among
themselves and became straight and stiff.
They were waiting—just waiting for some
one to come in and buy them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<span class="small">THE LITTLE GIRL</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Into</span> the store came a little girl, her
mother, and a little boy. They took their
places in the elevator and were lifted up,
just like a balloon, only different, of
course.</p>

<p>“May we stop in the toy department,
Mother?” asked the little girl. “I want
to look at some dolls.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked the boy.</p>

<p>“Because my birthday is next week,
Dick,” answered the little girl, whose
name was Dorothy. “It’s my birthday,
and maybe I’ll get a doll then, or for
Christmas.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“It isn’t my birthday until after Christmas,”
said Dick. “But I don’t want a
doll either of those times.”</p>

<p>“What do you want?” asked Mother,
smiling at her two children as she left the
elevator with them. “What would you
like, Richard?” she asked; for that was
Dick’s real name.</p>

<p>“A rocking horse,” he answered. “I’d
like a big rocking horse, and then I could
make believe I was a soldier captain going
to war.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll look through the toy department,”
promised the mother, and then
happy looks came over the faces of Dick
and Dorothy.</p>

<p>On the shelves and counters where, a
little while before in the half-darkness, the
Sawdust Doll, the Calico Clown, and the
other toys had had such fun, they now sat
or stood, as stiff as the ramrod in the gun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
of the Tin Soldier. Not one of them
moved, and the White Rocking Horse just
stared straight in front of him, looking at
the blackboard.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother, here are the dolls!” cried
Dorothy, and she pointed to a shelf back
of the counter on which the Calico Clown
stood near the Bold Tin Soldier. “See
the dolls on the shelves! Oh, what pretty
ones!”</p>

<p>“Would you like to look at the dolls?”
asked the girl behind the counter. She
worked in the store, and now she lifted
down the Sawdust Doll who had, only an
hour or so before, been riding on the back
of the White Rocking Horse.</p>

<p>“Here is a very pretty doll,” said the
girl clerk, who was pretty herself. “Her
eyes open and shut.”</p>

<p>“And they’re brown, too, just like
Dick’s!” whispered the little girl to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
mother, as she took the doll in her arms.
“Oh, please may I have her?”</p>

<p>“I’ll see,” answered the mother, and
from the way she said this, and because of
the smile on her face and the look in her
eyes, the little girl clapped her hands. I
think she knew her mother was going to
get her the doll she wanted.</p>

<p>For a moment the Sawdust Doll thought
the little girl was going to buy her and
take her home.</p>

<p>“I’d just love to go with her,” thought
the Sawdust Doll to herself. “She looks
like a kind, good little girl, and I’m sure
she wouldn’t leave me out in the rain all
night to get soaked through. I wonder if
I shall go to her house to live?”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” thought the Tin Captain
to himself, “I hope the Sawdust Doll isn’t
going to leave. I shall be lonesome if she
goes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>Just then there was a shout and some
jolly laughter down on the floor of the toy
department.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is what I want! This is what
I want!” cried Dorothy’s brother, Dick.
“Here’s the White Rocking Horse I
want!”</p>

<p>And the next moment he had leaped to
the saddle, and then he rocked to and fro
on the back of the white horse. The stirrups
jingled and the boy shook the reins
that were fast in the wooden mouth of the
horse.</p>

<p>“Gid-dap, White Rocking Horse!”
cried the boy. “I’m a cowboy! Gid-dap!”</p>

<p>“I thought you were going to be a soldier
captain,” said the little girl, who had
run from the doll counter when she heard
her brother’s joyous laughter.</p>

<p>“I’ll be a cowboy part of the time and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
a soldier the other part,” he said. “And
if you get a doll, Dorothy, I’ll let her ride
on my horse. Please, Mother, buy me
this!” he begged.</p>

<p>“Not now, Dick,” was Mother’s answer.
“But, if you like, you may write Santa
Claus a letter telling him you’d like this
horse for Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll do that!” cried the boy.</p>

<p>All day long boys and girls and fathers
and mothers and uncles, aunts and cousins
came to the toy department to look, and
some bought different things which they
took away with them, or had sent.</p>

<p>And though many dolls and clowns and
candy rabbits and monkeys on sticks were
taken from the shelves or the counters, the
particular friends about whom I have told
you were not sold. Once a lady came in,
and the Calico Clown was taken up and
shown to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“No, I believe I will not buy one to-day,”
said the lady.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad!” thought the Calico
Clown to himself. “When I’m bought I
want to be bought by a boy or a girl. I
can have more fun with them.”</p>

<p>And so the day passed. It began to get
dark and lights glowed in the store. The
stream of shoppers thinned out, and the
tired girls who waited behind the counters
put away their aprons and left for home.
The porters began to sweep, and then the
lights were put out one by one and only
the watchman was left in the store.</p>

<p>“Well, another day has gone!” said the
Sawdust Doll, as she sat up and waved her
hand to the Bold Tin Soldier.</p>

<p>“Yes, and it came nearly being your
last day with us,” remarked the Calico
Clown. “I heard what the little girl said.
I believe she is going to take you away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“Well, I shall be sorry to leave you, my
friends, of course,” said the Sawdust Doll.
“But that little girl looked kind and good.
I should not mind if she owned me.”</p>

<p>“Her brother was a jolly chap, too,”
said the White Rocking Horse. “He
jumped on my back and had a ride, but
he was very gentle with me. If I go to
anybody, I hope I go to him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you two seem to be going to have
nice homes,” said the Candy Rabbit. “I
hope I find as good a place.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said the Calico Clown.
“Well, all I want is to make some one
jolly! That’s the life for me! Whoop de-doodle-do!”
and he banged his cymbals
and shouted, as he could do, for there were
no boys or girls or grown folks there to
watch.</p>

<p>“What was that joke you were going
to tell us about an ear of corn?” asked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
Sawdust Doll. “May we not hear it now?
Let’s be jolly again! Let’s have another
party! Soon we may part, perhaps never
to meet again,” and she spoke rather
sadly.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t say that!” begged the Tin
Soldier, as he polished his sword on his
sleeve. “Don’t say that!” and he looked
at the Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha! Ha!” laughed the Calico
Clown. “Here’s a joke! How does the
lima bean succotash know when it’s time
for dinner?”</p>

<p>“Pooh! I don’t call that a joke,” said
the White Rocking Horse. “How can
succotash know when it’s time for dinner?”</p>

<p>“Because it hears the bell with the ear
of corn!” laughed the clown. “That’s the
time I fooled you! Well, now let’s have
another party!” he went on, jumping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
down from his shelf and pulling the tail
of the Monkey on a Stick.</p>

<p>“I hope the old rat doesn’t come again,”
said the Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>The toys were having grand fun again,
and the Bold Tin Soldier was helping the
Candy Rabbit up on the back of the White
Rocking Horse for a ride, when, all of a
sudden, the door of the toy department
opened and a big man came in.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” shrieked the Sawdust Doll,
and the Calico Clown jumped behind the
Jack-in-the-Box so quickly that his cymbals
rattled on the wooden nose of the
Lamb on Wheels.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<span class="small">IN AN AUTOMOBILE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Just</span> as soon, of course, as the door
opened and the man came in, all the toys
at once stopped moving about, and they
stopped talking and having fun. That is
because the man looked at them, and you
know I told you the moment a real, live
person looked at the toys, the Doll, Clown,
Rocking Horse, and all the others became
just like clothes-pins—they couldn’t and
wouldn’t move by themselves.</p>

<p>Slowly the big man walked into the
middle of the toy department and looked
about him. His eyes glanced at the Sawdust
Doll, and from her they went to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Tin Soldier. Neither of them so much as
wiggled a fingernail.</p>

<p>“But I was wondering, all the while,”
said the Sawdust Doll afterward, “if that
man was a burglar.”</p>

<p>“This is queer! When I was on the
floor below I thought surely I heard a noise
up here! I thought some one was in here
trying to get the Christmas things. But
that shan’t happen as long as I am watchman
here! No, indeed!”</p>

<p>The big man looked all around to make
sure no bad persons were hiding away to
take the toys after he had left. He looked
very sharply at the Calico Clown, the man
did.</p>

<p>“I thought surely I heard the rattle of
those cymbals the clown holds,” said the
man. “But perhaps it was the wind blowing
them, or a rat running over them.
There are rats in this store.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>The toys knew that very well, for they
had seen a large one. And wasn’t it queer
that the man had thought he heard the
cymbals jingle?</p>

<p>“He really did hear them, for I banged
them on the Lamb’s nose when I jumped
down,” said the Calico Clown afterward.</p>

<p>But of course the man did not know
that the toys could come to life and have a
party among themselves when no one was
looking, and so he thought the wind or a
rat had made the cymbals tinkle.</p>

<p>And when he was gone the Sawdust
Doll slowly raised her head from where
she had lain down on a shelf and said:</p>

<p>“Fancy now! How foolish I was to
think he was a robber! He is the good,
kind watchman of this store.”</p>

<p>“But of course we can’t allow him to
see us moving about, or hear us talk, any
more than we can let the girls and boys,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
said the Calico Clown, and he made such
a funny face that the White Rocking
Horse swung to and fro in laughter.</p>

<p>“Well, now that he’s gone, let’s have
some more fun,” cried the Candy Rabbit.
“Go on with the party.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I say!” chattered the
Monkey on a Stick, as he quickly climbed
up and down, so rapidly that the Sawdust
Doll cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t! You make me dizzy!”</p>

<p>“Yes, behave yourself,” said the Bold
Tin Soldier. “We can’t all be as lively as
you. Now, if you like, I’ll march out my
men and we will parade for you. How
will that do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, fine!” exclaimed the Sawdust Doll.
“I love parades! Don’t you?” she asked
the Calico Clown.</p>

<p>“Yes, they’re very nice,” he answered.
“And when the drum goes ‘Boom! Boom!’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
I feel like jumping up and down and banging
my cymbals.”</p>

<p>“Well, you may do that,” said the captain
of the Tin Soldiers. “We should all
be as jolly as we can, for there is no telling
now, from day to day, with Christmas
coming on, when one of us may be taken
away.”</p>

<p>The Sawdust Doll thought of the little
girl who had wanted her so much, and she
thought of what the mother had said:</p>

<p>“Put that brown-eyed doll away for me.
I shall come in again.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if she will really buy me for
her little girl,” thought the Sawdust
Doll.</p>

<p>And the White Rocking Horse remembered
the boy who had jumped on his back
and had taken a ride there in the store.</p>

<p>“I should like him for a master,”
thought the White Rocking Horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>“Well, now for the parade!” called the
Bold Tin Soldier smartly. “Fall in, my
men!”</p>

<p>“Fall in! Ha! Ha! Does he want
them to fall into the Goldfish tank?”
laughed the Calico Clown.</p>

<p>“Hush! Be quiet!” begged the Sawdust
Doll. “When a captain tells his soldiers
to ‘fall in’ he means for them to
stand in a straight line so they may
march.”</p>

<p>And that is just what the Tin Soldiers
did. They stood in line behind their captain,
who drew his shining tin sword, and
then they marched in and out among the
tables, counters and shelves of the toy department.</p>

<p>They right-wheeled and left-wheeled and
halted and went on the double-quick and
then they all stood up and fired their guns—make-believe,
of course, for the guns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
were only of tin, and had no powder in
them, not even talcum powder.</p>

<p>“But it’s lots of fun to make believe!”
said the Sawdust Doll, when the parade
had ended.</p>

<p>“Yes, it certainly is!” said the Calico
Clown. “And, speaking of fun, reminds
me of a joke. What part of a doll’s house
is hot and cold at the same time?”</p>

<p>“Ho! Such a thing can’t be!” exclaimed
the White Rocking Horse. “Nothing can
be hot and cold at the same time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it can!” said the Calico Clown.
“It’s the front door of the doll’s house.
The outside part of the door is cold, and
the inside part, nearest the fire, is hot. Ha,
Ha!” and he rattled his cymbals like anything.</p>

<p>And so the make-believe party of the
toys went on in the night. It was make-believe
only to such persons as you and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
me and the watchman. To the toys the
party was real enough, for they could talk
among themselves, and move and jump
about. But if any one had looked at them,
even a little baby, the toys would have been
as still and quiet as a hairpin. That’s the
funny part of it.</p>

<p>The Sawdust Doll was just having a
little dance with the Calico Clown, and the
Monkey on a Stick was asking the White
Rocking Horse to give him a ride around
the floor when, all of a sudden, the Lamb
on Wheels came rolling back from where
she had gone to look out of a window.</p>

<p>“The sun is coming up! The sun is coming
up!” cried the Lamb. “Back to your
places, every one of you. It will soon be
daylight and the people will begin coming
in.”</p>

<p>And, surely enough, a little while after
that, when all the toys were back in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
places, the store opened, the clerks took
their stand behind counters and in front of
shelves, and once more the busy shopping
day began.</p>

<p>“I wonder if anything will happen to
me to-day,” thought the Sawdust Doll as
she sat on her shelf, with other dolls and
toys around her. “I wonder if I shall ever
have any adventures. I wonder——”</p>

<p>And just then she was surprised to see,
coming toward the doll counter, the same
lady who, the day before, had been in with
the little girl Dorothy and the boy Dick.</p>

<p>“Where is that pretty doll I looked at
yesterday?” asked the lady of the girl
clerk. “I mean the one with the brown
eyes?”</p>

<p>“This is it, Madam,” was the answer.
“I put it aside for you,” and the girl lifted
down the Sawdust Doll. To look at her
you never would have thought that, a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
hours before, she had been dancing around
with the Calico Clown.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is the doll I want for my
little girl,” said the lady. “It is one of
the most beautiful I have seen in the store.
Her brown eyes are so very pretty. I’ll
take her.”</p>

<p>And then began some adventures for the
Sawdust Doll. She was dusted off with a
soft brush, and it tickled her face so that
she wanted to sneeze, but she knew she
would not dare do that with all the people
around. Then the clerk wrapped some
soft paper around her, and more paper on
the outside of that and tied it with a
string.</p>

<p>“Gracious! I hope I don’t smother!”
thought the Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>She wished she might have a chance to
say good-bye to the White Rocking Horse,
and to the Candy Rabbit, the Monkey on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
a Stick, the Bold Tin Soldier, the Lamb
on Wheels, and the Calico Clown.</p>

<p>But of course this could not be done
while all the people were looking on. But
the Tin Soldier, the Calico Clown, and
others were thinking to themselves rather
sad thoughts.</p>

<p>“There goes our Sawdust Doll!” thought
the Clown. “I suppose I’ll never see her
again.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll never have another chance to
drive a bad rat away from her with my
tin sword,” thought the Tin Soldier.</p>

<p>“She’ll never ride on my back again,”
mused the White Rocking Horse.</p>

<p>“Never again will she tell me how sweet
I am,” sighed the Candy Rabbit.</p>

<p>“She used to like to watch me go up and
down on my stick,” whispered the Monkey
to himself; “that is, when I didn’t go too
fast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“She used to feel my soft wool,” was
what the Lamb on Wheels thought to herself.</p>

<p>But the lady who had bought the Sawdust
Doll knew nothing of this. She took
the package the clerk gave her, and, with
it in her arms, got into her automobile.</p>

<p>“We’ll go home now,” said the lady to
the man who sat at the steering-wheel. “I
have the doll for Dorothy, so we’ll go
home.”</p>

<p>And, a moment later, the Sawdust Doll
was rolling smoothly over the streets on
her way to have new adventures. But she
could not help feeling sad when she
thought of the toys she had left behind in
the store.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<span class="small">THE BIRTHDAY PARTY</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Sawdust Doll could not see, of
course, all the things that happened on her
automobile ride, for she was wrapped in
paper from the store. But she could feel
the big machine gliding along on its rubber-tired
wheels, and she knew she was
having a ride.</p>

<p>“It may be nicer than a ride on the back
of the White Rocking Horse,” thought
the Sawdust Doll, “but it isn’t so much
fun, cooped up here as I am. I wish we’d
get where we’re going.”</p>

<p>And, soon enough, she had her wish.
Through the different streets rolled the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
automobile, and soon it came to a stop
near a pretty house in front of which was
a lawn. The lawn was green in summer,
but now, as it was near Christmas, there
was white snow on the grass.</p>

<p>“You may put the auto up now,” said
the lady to the driver. “I shall not be going
out again to-day. I must get ready
for Dorothy’s birthday party.”</p>

<p>And then the Sawdust Doll was carried
into the house. The lady hurried up the
stairs, holding the package under her fur
coat.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Mother?” called Dorothy
from the playroom.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the answer. “Stay there!
I’ll be with you in a moment. Is Dick
there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m here!” Dick answered. “I’m
making believe a chair is a rocking horse.
Did you bring me a rocking horse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
Mother?” he asked, and he came to the
door of the playroom.</p>

<p>“It isn’t Christmas yet,” Mother answered,
with a laugh. “Here, Martha,”
she quickly said to the maid. “Take this
doll. It’s for Dorothy’s birthday to-morrow.
Hide it away on top of a closet shelf
where Dorothy’ll not see it.”</p>

<p>The doll was laid away on a shelf in a
dark closet. That is, it was dark for a
time, but, after a while, the Sawdust Doll
began to see things faintly, just as she
used to look at things on the shelves and
counters of the toy store.</p>

<p>“Hello! Who’s there?” suddenly asked
a voice of the Sawdust Doll, and she knew,
right away, that it was a toy, like herself,
speaking. But all she could dimly see was
a small, square box in one corner of the
top clothes’-press shelf.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said a voice again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“Hello!” answered the Sawdust Doll
politely. “But I can’t see any one,” she
added.</p>

<p>“And no wonder! My spring is broken,
and I can’t put my head out to see you,
either,” the voice went on. “But I can
look at you through a crack.”</p>

<p>“A crack in what?” asked the Sawdust
Doll.</p>

<p>“A crack in my box,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Well, go on,” said the Sawdust Doll,
after a moment of silence.</p>

<p>“I’m Jack-in-the-Box,” the voice continued.
“I used to live in a toy store, and
I was bought last Christmas for the boy
who lives in this house. But after he had
played with me awhile, watching me jump
out of my box every time the lid was lifted,
my spring broke. I couldn’t jump any
more then, and the boy grew tired of me.
So I was put away on this shelf. Goodness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
how lonesome I’ve been! I’m glad
you came to keep me company. How long
are you going to stay?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered the Sawdust
Doll.</p>

<p>“I hope your spring isn’t broken, and
that you are not put here because you
aren’t of any more use as a toy,” said
Jack-in-the-Box.</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t any springs,” answered
the Doll. “I’m full of sawdust.”</p>

<p>“That’s better than having a spring inside
you,” said Jack. “You can’t break
sawdust.”</p>

<p>“No, but you can spill it,” the Doll went
on. “And that’s what I’m always afraid
of, that some day there’ll be an accident
and all my sawdust will run out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let us hope not!” exclaimed Jack.
“But, really, I’m glad you have come. I
was dreadfully lonesome here! Tell me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
about yourself. Tell me about your adventures.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t had many yet,” the Sawdust
Doll replied. “We used to have fun playing
party in the store after all the real
folks were gone. But I’d like to hear
about you. Having your spring broken
must be a very wonderful adventure indeed.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s wonderful, all right,” sighed
Jack. “But it isn’t much fun. If my
spring were not broken I could look out
now from the top of my box and see you
and talk to you much better. As it is, I
have to whisper through the crack.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t much fun talking through a
crack,” agreed the Sawdust Doll. “But
tell me about your spring.”</p>

<p>So Jack told how one day the boy
pushed him into the box too hard, and
slammed the cover down so quickly that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
there was a snip and a snap, and poor
Jack’s spring broke. Never after that
could he jump out of his box with a squeak
whenever the lid was lifted.</p>

<p>“And now I want to hear about you,”
said Jack. So the Sawdust Doll told about
her friends in the store, and how the Bold
Tin Soldier had driven the rat back to his
hole.</p>

<p>For some little time the Jack-in-the-Box
and the Sawdust Doll remained on the
closet shelf, talking together in the make-believe
language of toys—a language no
real persons ever hear, any more than they
can see the toys at play.</p>

<p>Then, the next day, the closet door suddenly
opened, and a flood of light came in.</p>

<p>“Ha! I think they’ve come for you,”
whispered Jack.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s for you,” the Doll answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“Oh, no, my days are over,” was the
Jack’s reply. “Nobody wants to play with
a broken toy. I’ll stay here a long time,
I suppose. But your adventures are just
beginning.”</p>

<p>And that is just what happened. The
Sawdust Doll was lifted down off the
shelf, and a beautiful dress was put on
her. It was made of silk, and was the color
of a rose.</p>

<p>“You are as nice a doll as any little girl
could wish,” said Martha, the maid, as she
tied a blue sash on the Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>There was a looking-glass in the room
where the maid was dressing the toy for
the birthday party, and the Sawdust Doll
had a look at herself in the mirror.</p>

<p>“My, how nice I look,” thought the doll.
“This is much nicer than wearing nothing
but a bit of cheese cloth, as I did in the
store. I won’t catch cold now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>The rose silk dress was fastened on the
doll, and then Mother came to get the toy.</p>

<p>“It is almost time for Dorothy’s party,”
said Mother. “I hope she will like her
doll. I’ll take it down.”</p>

<p>Down the stairs the Sawdust Doll was
carried, and a moment later, she found herself
in a room that was filled with little
girls and boys. The girls all wore pretty
dresses and the boys had their hair
combed, so the Sawdust Doll began to
think it was a party. And when she heard
the guests say to Dorothy that they
wished her “many happy returns,” the
Sawdust Doll knew it was a birthday
party.</p>

<p>“Here you are, little daughter!” said
Mother to Dorothy. “Here is a present
for you,” and the Sawdust Doll was handed
to the little girl.</p>

<p>Dorothy’s eyes shone in delight, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
danced up and down as she hugged the toy
close in her arms.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s the very doll I wanted!” cried
Dorothy. “It’s the same one I saw in the
store! Look, Dick!” she called to her
brother, showing him her new pet. “Don’t
you remember? This doll was in the store
where you rode the White Rocking
Horse!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I wish I had the Rocking
Horse now!” exclaimed Dick. “But dolls
are all right for girls, and I’m glad you
have a new one, Dorothy,” he added, feeling
he had not been very polite. “She is
pretty.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my doll is lovely!” said Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Indeed she is!” cried all the other
girls. And though each one of them had
a doll, none was any prettier or more beautifully
dressed than the Sawdust Doll.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p058.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p class="caption">Carlo Runs Away With the Sawdust Doll<br>

<span class="illoright2"><i>Page <a href="#Page_63">63</a></i></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>Then the party fun began. The boys
and girls played games and danced to music.
Some of the girls even danced with
the Sawdust Doll, and I think it was very
good of Dorothy to let them play with her
beautiful new doll. But they were very
careful.</p>

<p>“I like birthday parties,” thought the
Sawdust Doll. “I wish the Bold Tin Soldier
and the Calico Clown were here to
enjoy this one.”</p>

<p>After the children had played games
they had good things to eat, for that is one
of the best things at a party. And while
the children ate cake and ice cream the
Sawdust Doll was laid aside. She found
herself lying on a table near a big pin-cushion
that was tied with a yellow
ribbon.</p>

<p>“I hope none of the pins or needles
come out and stick me,” thought the Doll,
as she looked at them. “If I get a hole in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
me all my sawdust will run out, and that
would be dreadful.”</p>

<p>Dorothy’s new toy, lying on a table near
the pin-cushion in a side room, could hear
the joyous shouts and laughter of the children
at the birthday party. She could
hear the rattle of spoons and of the ice-cream
dishes.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, when it was very still
and quiet in the room where the Sawdust
Doll was lying, there came a growling
noise.</p>

<p>“Gracious me!” thought the Sawdust
Doll, “I wonder if that is Buster the Bear
whom Jack was telling me about. I wonder!”</p>

<p>She started to rise and look around, but
she was afraid to do this for fear some prying
boy or girl might be looking. And the
toys never dare move if any one looks at
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>Then, after the growl, there came a bark—a
loud bark.</p>

<p>“That can’t be a bear!” thought the
Sawdust Doll. “Bears don’t bark—they
growl. But I remember there was a
Fuzzy Dog in Toy Town. He used to
growl and wag his tail when he was wound
up. I wonder if the Fuzzy Dog could be
here? I wish I dared look.”</p>

<p>And then something dreadful happened.
At least it was dreadful to the Sawdust
Doll. For a shaggy dog, one she knew was
real and not a toy, rushed up to her,
growling and barking. And the next moment
the Sawdust Doll was caught up in
the dog’s mouth, dragged from the table
and carried away!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<span class="small">IN THE DOG HOUSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Carlo</span>, the shaggy dog, who lived in the
same house with Dorothy and Dick, was
not a bad dog. But he liked to find new
things to pick up in his teeth, shake, and
then carry off. Sometimes he hid the
things he carried off in this way, and they
were not found for a long time afterward.
Often he would take the ball Dick played
with and run off with that. But when Dick
saw Carlo doing this he chased the dog and
got back the ball.</p>

<p>However, this time no one saw Carlo
taking away the Sawdust Doll. The dog
had watched his chance, and when he saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
Dorothy and the other girls and boys in
the dining-room, eating cake and ice
cream, Carlo just thought to himself:</p>

<p>“Now I can run in and grab something!
I saw Dorothy put something up on the
table. Maybe it’s a ball that I can have
fun with!”</p>

<p>So Carlo hurried into the room where
he had seen Dorothy lay something down,
and, as the table was not very high, Carlo
jumped right up on it.</p>

<p>“Oh, here’s something fine for me to
carry away!” said the dog to himself, and
then he picked up the Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>Out of the room, down the hall and past
the dining-room where the children were
having such jolly times ran Carlo with the
Sawdust Doll in his mouth. He did not
hurt her, for he did not really bite her. He
only carried her as a mother cat carries
her kittens by the backs of their necks.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
Besides, being stuffed with sawdust as she
was, the Doll could not feel pain. Of
course her feelings were hurt a little when
the dog grabbed her up so suddenly, but
she seemed to know she would not really
be harmed.</p>

<p>“There you are!” said Carlo, in dog
language, as he dropped the Sawdust Doll
down in the straw of his kennel, or house,
at the end of the yard. “There you are!
No one will find you here!”</p>

<p>The Sawdust Doll did not answer the
dog, even though she may have known
what he said. Pet animals and toy pets
do not speak the same sort of talk, at least
to one another. And pet animals can move
about and bark or mew whether any real
folks are looking at them or not. Toy
dolls, rocking horses, and monkeys are not
like that. They never move, or do anything
if you watch them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Carlo scuttled around in the straw until
he had covered the Sawdust Doll from
sight in his kennel. Then, wagging his
tail, as though he had done something
smart, he went back to the party.</p>

<p>“I’m glad he’s gone,” said the Doll.</p>

<p>Carlo liked parties—there were always
stray bits of cake dropping on the floor and
Carlo could pick them up. He didn’t mind
it because they had been on the carpet.
And it was good for the carpet to have him
pick them up.</p>

<p>So, leaving the Sawdust Doll in his kennel,
Carlo ran back to the house. He
wagged his tail as he thought of the good
things the boys and girls might give him.
And they sometimes did give him good
things. As soon as he trotted in through
the kitchen, where the door had been left
open to bring in another freezer of ice
cream, Carlo found a piece of cake on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
floor. That made him wag his tail harder
than before.</p>

<p>But the poor Sawdust Doll! Think of
her left all alone out in the straw of the
dog’s kennel, with her new rose-colored
silk dress on! Wasn’t that too bad?</p>

<p>“This certainly is an adventure!” said
the Sawdust Doll to herself. “I’m glad
this straw is nice and warm, or I might get
cold. But I don’t exactly like it here. It
was better even on the closet shelf with
Jack-in-the-Box, though he did have to
talk through a crack to me.”</p>

<p>For some time the Sawdust Doll lay in
the straw of the dog kennel. She sat up
and looked about her, for, there being no
one there with human eyes to watch, the
toy could do as she pleased. She even got
up and walked about, though it was hard
work because the long pieces of straw were
tangled in her feet. She went to the door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
of the kennel and looked out, first making
sure no one was in the yard to see her.</p>

<p>“Dear me! I never could walk back
to the house through the snow,” said
the Sawdust Doll to herself. “If it were
summer time I might try it after dark,
when every one had gone to bed. But I
never could do it now in the snow. I’d
simply catch cold and have the sawdust
fever. No, I shall have to stay here until
some one comes for me. I hope that nice
girl Dorothy misses me soon, and comes
and gets me.”</p>

<p>And, surely enough, Dorothy did miss
her doll shortly after that. The cake, ice
cream, and other good things had been
eaten, and after some games had been
played by the boys and girls, Dorothy said:</p>

<p>“Now let’s get my new doll again, girls!
She must be lonesome waiting for us to
get through with our cake and ice cream.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“Yes, we’ll get your doll,” said another
girl.</p>

<p>Dorothy ran to the table where she had
put her Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>“Why! Why!” cried the little girl.
“She isn’t here! She’s gone!”</p>

<p>“What is gone, Dorothy?” asked
Mother. “Your piece of cake? You
shouldn’t have left it on the table, my
dear.”</p>

<p>“No, Mother, I didn’t leave any cake on
the table,” Dorothy said. “It was my new
Sawdust Doll. I left her here, and now
she is gone!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is too bad!” said Dorothy’s
mother. “But are you sure you left your
doll on this table?” she asked the little
girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” answered Dorothy.</p>

<p>“I saw the Sawdust Doll lying there,”
said Helen, one of the party guests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“So did I,” chimed in Dick.</p>

<p>And then Dorothy looked sharply at her
brother.</p>

<p>“Did you take my doll?” she asked him
suddenly. “Did you take my new doll that
mother just gave me for my birthday?”</p>

<p>“Course I didn’t!” cried Dick. “Why
should I take your doll? I don’t play with
dolls!”</p>

<p>“Dorothy thought perhaps you had
taken it in fun,” gently said Mother. “If
you didn’t, perhaps Martha laid it in another
place. We must look for the Sawdust
Doll.”</p>

<p>“We can make a game of it—like hide
the thimble!” cried Dick.</p>

<p>“I don’t want my Sawdust Doll made
into a game!” exclaimed Dorothy, who was
feeling sad.</p>

<p>“It is only in fun, and make believe,”
said Mother. “That will be a good way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
find your pet, my dear. Come, children,
look for Dorothy’s doll.”</p>

<p>The Sawdust Doll was not the only one
Dorothy had, but as it was her newest toy
she wanted that just then more than any
of the others. So she helped her boy and
girl friends look in the different rooms for
the missing doll. The maid said she had
not taken the Sawdust Doll away, and no
one could imagine where she was. And
the tears came into Dorothy’s eyes as minute
after minute passed and the new toy
was not found.</p>

<p>And now we must see what is happening
to the Sawdust Doll. For some time,
after going to the door of the kennel to
look out, she lay quietly in the straw. It
kept her warm, for there was no fire in
Carlo’s house, as there was in the house
where Dorothy and Dick lived.</p>

<p>After a while the Sawdust Doll heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
some one walking toward the kennel. She
knew the sound of human footsteps, for
she had often heard them in the department
store. And she knew it was not the
Bold Tin Soldier or the Calico Clown
coming toward her now.</p>

<p>“I wish it were one of my friends,”
thought the Sawdust Doll; “but it cannot
be. This person walks just like the watchman
in the store. I wonder who it is.”</p>

<p>And then a loud but pleasant voice spoke,
and a man said:</p>

<p>“Well, well! I almost forgot about putting
some clean straw in Carlo’s kennel!
That straw he has must be all wet with the
snow. I’ll rake that out and put in fresh
for the dog. It will keep him warmer to-night.”</p>

<p>Something long and black, with sharp
iron teeth, was thrust into the kennel, and
the next moment the straw was raked out,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
and the Sawdust Doll went with it. Out
she came in the midst of the straw.</p>

<p>The big gardener, for he it was who was
going to give Carlo clean straw, examined
what he had raked out. He saw something
pink, and, looking at it, he said:</p>

<p>“Dear me, what a funny bone! Where
could that have come from?”</p>

<p>He thought the Sawdust Doll was a bone
that Carlo had hidden in the kennel.</p>

<p>“Why! Why, it isn’t a bone after all!”
exclaimed the gardener, as he picked it up
and looked at it more carefully. “It’s a
doll! A Sawdust Doll! I wonder where
she came from!” and he turned the toy
over and over in his hands.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<span class="small">IN THE RAG-BAG</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Sawdust Doll felt much better when
the gardener had picked her out of the
straw that he had raked from Carlo’s kennel.
For, though the Sawdust Doll was
only make-believe alive, she knew when
real persons handled her. Surely she
ought to, for she had been handled enough
times since she was first made in the workshop
of Santa Claus.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness some one has me in
charge besides that fuzzy little dog!” said
the Sawdust Doll to herself. “I don’t like
him at all, though I don’t suppose he really
meant to be mean to me. But I’m glad the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
gardener has me. I hope he likes dolls,
and doesn’t throw me into the ash-barrel!”</p>

<p>The gardener was not going to do anything
like that. He knew a good, new doll
when he saw one. And as he looked at the
rosily dressed toy in his hands, and then
glanced toward the house, the man shook
his head.</p>

<p>And the Doll stared at the man.</p>

<p>“I think some of the boys must have
been playing tricks on the girls at the
party,” said the gardener. “Some of the
boys must have hidden this doll out in the
straw. I’m glad I found her. I’ll take
her back. Dorothy will know to which
little girl she belongs.”</p>

<p>So, dropping the rake with which he had
been cleaning out Carlo’s kennel, the gardener
walked up to the house, and, wiping
his feet at the back kitchen door, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
knew the cook did not want her floor made
dirty, in the gardener went.</p>

<p>The cook was beginning to wash the cake
and ice-cream dishes, for the eating part
of the party was over.</p>

<p>“Look here, Mary,” said the gardener to
the cook, holding out the Sawdust Doll.
“See what I found in Carlo’s kennel.”</p>

<p>“Oh, for the love of peach pie!” cried
the jolly cook. “That’s Dorothy’s doll!
Where ever did you find her? The whole
house has been upset looking for her.
Where was she?”</p>

<p>“Out in the dog’s kennel. Some of the
boys must have carried her there for a
joke.”</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho! It wasn’t any of the boys!”
laughed the cook. “It must have been
Carlo himself. That dog is up to so many
tricks. He carried off Dorothy’s doll!”</p>

<p>“Well, the doll isn’t harmed any,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
the gardener. “She was in the clean
straw. Will you take her to Dorothy?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I will, the poor little dear!
She’s been crying for fear her new doll
was lost. Thank you, Patrick! I’ll tell
Dorothy you found her doll for her.”</p>

<p>And when the cook went into the room
where Dorothy and her little guests were
still hunting for the missing doll, you can
easily guess what joyous shouts there were.</p>

<p>“Oh, there she is! There she is!” cried
Dorothy, when she saw her new birthday
toy. “Where did you find her, Mary?”
she asked, taking the Sawdust Doll in her
arms.</p>

<p>“Patrick found her in the dog’s kennel,”
the cook answered.</p>

<p>“Oh, Carlo! You bad dog!” cried Dorothy,
and she shook her finger at the curly
poodle, who had come back to the house
to see if he could not get another piece of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
cake. “You’re a very bad dog to take my
doll away!”</p>

<p>And though perhaps Carlo did not know
what it was all about, he must have felt
that he had done something wrong, for he
ran out of the house and crawled into his
kennel, where, by this time, Patrick had
put some new straw.</p>

<p>“Where’s that thing I left here a while
ago?” said Carlo to himself, as he fussed
around in the straw. “Where’s that pink
thing I took off the table? I was going to
have some fun with it, but now it’s gone!”</p>

<p>And of course it was gone, for Dorothy
had her Sawdust Doll back again, and
Carlo was very much surprised to find his
plaything gone.</p>

<p>“Now we can have some nice games,”
said Dorothy, when she had smoothed out
the pink dress of her toy. For the dress
had been a little wrinkled by Carlo’s teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>And then what fun there was at the
birthday party! Dorothy did not feel unhappy
any longer, and she and the boys
and girls played games.</p>

<p>“Did you have a nice time at your party,
Dorothy?” asked Mother, when the little
girl was going to bed that night.</p>

<p>“Oh, I had a lovely time!” was the
sleepy answer. “And so did my Sawdust
Doll. Thank you very much, Mother, for
giving her to me.”</p>

<p>And Dorothy went to sleep, hugging her
Sawdust Doll in her arms.</p>

<p>The Sawdust Doll did not go to sleep
right away, though. She remained awake,
even though it was very dark in Dorothy’s
room, only a little night-light gleaming
in the hall.</p>

<p>“I do wish some of my friends from
Toy Town were here,” thought the Sawdust
Doll to herself, as she lay in the bed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
with Dorothy. “I wish I could talk to the
Calico Clown and the Bold Tin Soldier,
and tell them of my adventures. I’m sure
neither of them was ever carried off by a
dog and hidden in a kennel. That is a
most wonderful adventure, I’m sure!”</p>

<p>And, after a while, when Dorothy was
sound asleep, and it was all still and quiet
in the house, after the party, the Sawdust
Doll did just as she had done in the store—she
made believe come to life and moved
about. For there was no one to watch her—she
took good care of that. And Carlo
was out in his kennel, so he could not carry
her off again.</p>

<p>Softly and carefully the Sawdust Doll
got out of Dorothy’s bed, climbed down by
a chair, and walked over to the room
where, on a shelf in the closet, the poor,
broken Jack-in-the-Box had to stay.</p>

<p>There was a long scarf hanging from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
the shelf down to the floor, and the scarf
had holes in it like a piece of lace. So, as
the Sawdust Doll was not very heavy, and
as the Monkey on a Stick had taught her
something about climbing, the Sawdust
Doll climbed the scarf-ladder until she
reached the shelf.</p>

<p>“Hello! who’s there?” asked the Jack,
suddenly awakening in his box.</p>

<p>“It is I,” answered the Sawdust Doll.
“I came to tell you about my adventure.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is very kind of you,” said
Jack. “I wish I could spring up and see
you, but I’ll just have to look at you
through a crack in my box. You have no
idea how troublesome it is to have a broken
spring.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can well imagine that it isn’t
very jolly,” said the Sawdust Doll. “But
I’ll come close to your crack so I can whisper
through it, and tell you all about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
party and my adventure in the dog kennel.”</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted to hear it,” said
the Jack, most politely.</p>

<p>So up there in the dark, on the closet
shelf, where no one could see them any
more than the toys in the store could be
seen at their midnight frolics, the Sawdust
Doll and the Jack-in-the-Box talked to
one another.</p>

<p>“Dear me! That was quite remarkable,”
said Jack, when the Sawdust Doll
had finished her story. “Just fancy! I
never had anything like that happen to
me!”</p>

<p>“But then, you see, you are not stuffed
with sawdust,” returned the Doll, though
not at all proudly.</p>

<p>“No, of course that makes a difference,”
the Jack-in-the-Box said. “But once,
when I was shut up in my box, the black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
cat came and began to play with the cover.
She touched the catch with her paw, open
flew the box, and I jumped out right in her
face! Say, Miss Sawdust Doll, I wish you
could have seen that cat run! I just wish
you had been there!”</p>

<p>“Did she go fast?”</p>

<p>“Did she go fast? I should say she did!
I never saw a toy train go any faster. But
of course that was in the long-ago days,
before my spring was broken,” sadly said
Jack.</p>

<p>“I am sorry for you,” softly said the
Sawdust Doll. “Maybe, some day, you
will be mended.”</p>

<p>“No, I am afraid it is too late,” sighed
Jack.</p>

<p>So he and the Sawdust Doll talked together
until, all of a sudden, Jack called
out:</p>

<p>“Hark!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“What’s the matter?” asked the Sawdust
Doll.</p>

<p>“The cook is grinding the coffee,” was
the answer. “That means she is up and
getting breakfast. It will soon be daylight.
You had better go back where you
came from. It would never do for you to
be seen moving about. Folks would think
you were alive.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I had better go back,” said the
Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>Down the scarf-ladder she went, and
soon she was in bed with Dorothy again,
and when the little girl awakened she
never knew that her Sawdust Doll had
been wandering about in the night, talking
to Jack-in-the-Box.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear!” exclaimed Dorothy,
when, fully awake, she looked at her Sawdust
Doll on the pillow. “You have a big
spot of ice cream on your new rose-colored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
silk dress! That must have happened at
the party. Oh, dear! But I know what I
can do! I’ll make you a gingham dress to
wear around every day. Yes, that’s what
I’ll do! I’ll make you a gingham dress!”</p>

<p>And after breakfast the little girl asked
her mother if it would not be a fine thing
to make an every-day dress for the Sawdust
Doll.</p>

<p>“I think it would be very nice,” Mother
answered. “You may take my rag-bag.
You’ll find some odd pieces in it and you
can, very nicely, make a doll’s dress from
them.”</p>

<p>So Dorothy got the rag-bag and, placing
her doll down on a low bench near her,
began to measure her new toy for a gingham
dress.</p>

<p>“Then if you drop ice cream on yourself
it won’t be so bad,” said the little girl.
“A gingham dress will wash.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>All the morning long Dorothy sewed
away on the dress for the Sawdust Doll.
She had it nearly done, while the Doll lay
on a pile of cloth near the rag-bag ready
to be fitted.</p>

<p>Dorothy was just sewing a sleeve in the
gingham dress, and thinking how nice it
would look on her doll, when there came a
ring at the door, and Mirabell, a little girl
who lived in the next house, came in.</p>

<p>“Can you come over a minute, Dorothy?”
asked Mirabell. “My mother is
baking, and she said I could make a little
pie all by myself. And there’s enough
dough so you can make one, too! Come
on over!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that will be fun!” cried Dorothy,
and, forgetting for a moment all about her
Sawdust Doll and the new gingham dress,
up jumped Dorothy and away she ran with
Mirabell, leaving the pieces of cloth, rags,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
rag-bag, Doll and everything on the floor.</p>

<p>When Martha, the maid, came in a little
later and saw the pile in confusion on the
floor, she just bundled everything up together—new
gingham dress, rags, Doll,
and all—and stuffed them into the rag-bag.</p>

<p>“Dorothy forgot to pick up her playthings,”
thought the maid, as she stuffed
the odd pieces of cloth into the rag-bag.
“I’ll do it for her.”</p>

<p>And the maid never knew that she had
also put the Sawdust Doll into the rag-bag.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<span class="small">IN THE JUNK SHOP</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear</span> me!” exclaimed the Sawdust Doll
to herself, as she felt that she was being
stuffed into the rag-bag. “Dear me! This
is dreadful! What sort of an adventure
am I going to have now?”</p>

<p>The maid carried the rag-bag to the cellar,
where there was a much larger bag,
containing more rags, pieces of old carpet
and other trash.</p>

<p>“It is nearly time Patrick sold the
rags,” said the maid, as she emptied the
contents of the small rag-bag into the
larger one. The small rag-bag was kept
in the sewing-room, where odds and ends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
were put into it day by day until it was
filled. Then it was emptied into the larger
bag down in the cellar, and, when that was
full, it was sold to the junk man. Patrick,
the gardener, usually attended to this, and
he divided the money he got from selling
the rags with Martha, the maid, who emptied
the smaller bag.</p>

<p>“I must tell Patrick to sell the rags to
the first junk man he sees,” said Martha
to herself, as she emptied the small bag,
Sawdust Doll and all, into the larger bag
in the cellar.</p>

<p>The poor Sawdust Doll was tumbled out
from one bag to the other in the midst of
bundles of cloth, and the poor thing dared
not say a word, or try to get out, for if she
had Martha, the maid, would have seen
her, and that isn’t allowed, you know.</p>

<p>“Patrick! Patrick!” called Martha to
the gardener, as he was putting up a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
clothes line in the yard, for the laundress
was washing out the napkins the children
had used at the little girl’s birthday party.
“Oh, Patrick!” called Martha.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! What is it?” asked the gardener,
as he finished tying the line to the
clothes post.</p>

<p>“You’d better sell the rags to the first
junk man that comes along,” answered
Martha. “I just emptied some more into
the big bag, and there’s quite a lot now.
The bag is nearly full.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll sell ’em!” Patrick called
back.</p>

<p>And a little while after that, before Dorothy
had come home from Mirabell’s house
where she had gone to help make a little
pie, the jingling-jangling bells on a junk
wagon were heard out in the street.</p>

<p>“Hi there! Hi there!” called Patrick,
who, having finished tying the clothes line,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
was out in the garage. “Hi there, junk
man! Come here! I have some rags to
sell you!”</p>

<p>“And I want to buy rags,” answered
the junk man.</p>

<p>He came in with his own big bag, and
into that all the rags from the bag in the
cellar were emptied. And nobody saw the
Sawdust Doll tumbled out, in the midst
of the rags, from one bag to the other.
Patrick did not see the Sawdust Doll, nor
did Martha, the maid, nor the junk man.
He thought he was just buying rags—not
a Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>The rags were weighed, paid for, and
tossed into the junk man’s wagon. Then
he drove off with them—drove off with the
Sawdust Doll in the middle of his old bag
of rags, and he didn’t know a thing about
it!</p>

<p>But the Sawdust Doll, herself, very well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
knew that something strange was happening
to her.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” she sighed. “I don’t know
whether I like this adventure or not! I
wonder what will happen next!”</p>

<p>Away rattled the junk wagon, the
ragged man on the seat calling from time
to time:</p>

<p>“Any rags? Any bottles? Any old
clothes?”</p>

<p>He bought almost anything, did that
junk man, but he never before, that he
knew of, had bought a Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>When Dorothy came back from the
house next door, after having helped Mirabell
bake a little pie, the first thing she
thought of was her Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>“I must finish making her gingham
dress,” thought the little girl. But when
she hurried to the playroom and saw nothing
of the pile of rags she had left there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
with her thimble and needle on a table
near by, and when she saw nothing of her
doll, the little girl cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, where is she? Where is she?”</p>

<p>“Where is who, my dear?” asked
Mother.</p>

<p>“My Sawdust Doll,” answered Dorothy,
and tears began to gather in her eyes.
“I left her here asleep on a pile of rags
while I went to Mirabell’s house. Now
she’s gone! My Sawdust Doll is gone!
Oh, maybe Carlo carried her off again!”</p>

<p>“If he did we shall soon find her,” answered
Mother. “I’ll help you look.”</p>

<p>But Carlo was not around, and, a little
later, when Dick came in, he said the dog
had been down the street, playing with
him.</p>

<p>“Carlo didn’t take your doll, I know
that,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“But who did?” asked Dorothy. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
left her right near the little rag-bag, after
I got some pieces from it to make her a
gingham dress.”</p>

<p>It did not take long to find out what had
happened. When Martha, the maid, heard
Dorothy asking about the small rag-bag
and the pile of goods that had been on the
playroom floor, the maid exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, I picked them up! I picked up
the rags, put them in the little rag-bag,
and emptied them into the big bag in the
cellar. I must have picked up the Sawdust
Doll, too, though I didn’t notice
her.”</p>

<p>“Well, she must be down in the cellar
bag, then,” said Mother. “Don’t worry,
Dorothy. We’ll soon have your doll
back.”</p>

<p>But when Dorothy, Mother, and Martha
went to the cellar they saw the big bag
limp and empty, hanging on a nail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“Oh, Patrick must have sold the rags!”
said Martha.</p>

<p>And when they asked Patrick about it,
of course that was what he had done; just
as Martha had told him to do.</p>

<p>“I’ll get her back!” cried Patrick.
“I’ll keep watch, and when I see that junk
man going past again I’ll get your doll
back, Dorothy.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you find him now?” asked the
little girl. “I want my new Sawdust Doll
awful much! Something is always happening
to her! First Carlo took her off
to his kennel, then she got ice cream on
her dress, and now a junk man has her!
Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>“I’ll get her back! I’ll get the Sawdust
Doll back!” said Patrick, and he hurried
out to the street, thinking perhaps the
junk man might be just around the corner.</p>

<p>But the junk man was not in sight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
With his wagon filled with rags and bundles
of newspapers, with the Sawdust Doll
all wrapped up in pieces of cloth in one
of his bags, the junk man was far away.</p>

<p>All day long the junk man drove through
different streets buying odds and ends,
and, all this while, he never knew he had
the Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>And poor Dorothy was crying her eyes
out for her pet. She had other dolls, but
she wanted, most of all, to have her birthday
present back again.</p>

<p>At night the junk man drove to his shop,
where he kept many piles of rags, bottles,
old automobile tires and different things
that he sold to other men.</p>

<p>After supper the bag, in which was the
Sawdust Doll, was brought from the wagon
into the junk shop, and emptied out on
the floor.</p>

<p>“Want to help me sort the rags, Tinka?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
called the junk man to his little girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I love to sort the rags,” Tinka
answered. She was about as old as
Dorothy, but she did not live in such a
nice house. “I will sort the rags,” said
Tinka. “If I find a pretty one, may I
have a piece for a hair-ribbon?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered her father, and he and
Tinka began sorting over the rags to pick
out the silk and woolen ones from the linen
and cotton.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tinka uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“Oh, look what I’ve found!” she exclaimed.
“A doll! A real doll! Oh,
Papa! I have found a doll and she’s new!
A doll with a pink dress!”</p>

<p>And Tinka held up the Sawdust Doll!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<span class="small">A HAPPY VISIT</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> junk man dropped a bundle of rags
he was sorting and came around to the side
of the table where Tinka stood with the
Sawdust Doll in her arms. The little girl
was crooning to the Doll a lullaby that was
sung in ancient times by an ancient people.</p>

<p>“Let me see the Sawdust Doll, Tinka!”
said the junk man.</p>

<p>“Oh, but, Papa, she is asleep, now,” said
Tinka softly.</p>

<p>“I will not wake her up,” and the junk
man smiled at his little daughter. “I will
be careful not to wake her up.”</p>

<p>Then Tinka handed her father the Sawdust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
Doll. The junk man turned her over
and over in his hands, which were not very
clean. Junk men cannot keep their hands
clean when they work any more than the
coal man can.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” thought the Sawdust Doll
as she felt herself being turned over and
over in the grimy hands of the junk man.
“I hope he doesn’t soil my rose-colored
silk dress any more than it is. But then
I am going to have a new gingham one,
anyhow. Oh, no! How can I have the new
gingham dress if I stay here in this junk
shop?” thought the Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>You see, though Tinka made believe the
Sawdust Doll was asleep, Dorothy’s pet
was really awake, and knew what was going
on. Though, of course, the Sawdust
Doll would not move or speak as long as
Tinka and her father were looking on.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the junk man slowly, “this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
is almost new. And yet she was in a bag
of rags. There must be some mistake.”</p>

<p>The junk man laid the Sawdust Doll on
the table, and began thinking over in his
mind the different houses he had called at
that day to get bags of rags and bundles
of papers. Tinka slowly came around
from her side of the table, and gently
picked up the Sawdust Doll again.</p>

<p>“She is still asleep,” whispered the little
girl. “But I will sing to her once more.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sing, Tinka,” replied the junk
man. “Sing to the Doll, and then we must
put her away, for I shall take her back in
the morning.”</p>

<p>“Take her back! Oh, Papa! Are you
going to take away the new Doll I found
in the rags?” and tears came into Tinka’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, little daughter, she is not our
Doll,” sadly answered the junk man. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
bought the rags, not the Doll. Some little
girl owns her, and wants the Sawdust Doll
as much as you do. It would not be right
for us to keep her.”</p>

<p>Tinka said nothing for a moment. She
just held the Sawdust Doll in her arms and
looked at her, and she looked at the pretty
rose-colored silk dress. And Tinka never
saw the ice-cream spot on it. If she had
seen it she would not have cared.</p>

<p>“I must take the Doll back to-morrow,”
said the junk man slowly. “I remember
now where I bought the rags in which the
Sawdust Doll must have fallen or been put
by mistake. A gardener at a big house
called me in and sold me the rags. He has
sold me some before. In the morning, before
I go anywhere else, I will take the
Sawdust Doll back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Papa!” exclaimed Tinka, and that
was all she said, but she hugged the Sawdust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Doll tightly in her arms. And when
the junk man saw that he said:</p>

<p>“You may hold the Doll until it is time
for you to go to bed, Tinka. You may
hold her and sing to her. I will sort the
rags myself.”</p>

<p>So Tinka sat down on a pile of old
papers and rocked herself slowly to and
fro, singing the old sweet lullaby to the
Sawdust Doll. And the Sawdust Doll
closed her eyes and seemed to go to sleep.
But she was really awake, and she was
thinking of many things.</p>

<p>“This junk shop is not as nice a place
as the home I had with Dorothy,” thought
the Sawdust Doll. “But Tinka loves me,
and, after all, that is what counts. If ever
I see my old friends in the store, of what
an adventure I shall be able to tell them!
Quite wonderful! How surprised the
Bold Tin Soldier will be, and how the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
Calico Clown will laugh when he hears I
was in a rag-bag!”</p>

<p>The junk man looked across the room
and saw Tinka nodding sleepily. Gently
he took the Sawdust Doll from her arms
and laid the toy on a piece of paper up on
the mantel. Then he carried Tinka to her
own bed, and the little girl murmured in
her sleep:</p>

<p>“Oh, what a beautiful Sawdust Doll!”</p>

<p>The junk man sighed.</p>

<p>So the Sawdust Doll was laid by herself
on the mantel, and she thought many
thoughts as the night passed. She could
have moved around if she had wanted to,
for no one was watching her now.</p>

<p>“But what is the use?” she asked herself.
“There is no one here to play with—only
bags of rags, bundles of paper, and
such things as that. There is not even a
broken Jack-in-the-Box for me to talk to.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
I shall sleep. In the morning I may have
more adventures.”</p>

<p>And very early the next morning, before
Tinka was awake, the junk man drove off.
And, on the seat beside him, wrapped in a
paper, was the Sawdust Doll.</p>

<p>“I certainly am getting more than my
share of rides,” thought the Sawdust Doll.
“I wonder what is going to happen now!”</p>

<p>All the while the Sawdust Doll had been
away on the junk-shop adventure, about
which I have told you, poor Dorothy was
almost heart-broken over the loss of her
toy.</p>

<p>“Do you think I’ll ever get her back?”
she asked over and over again.</p>

<p>“I hope you may get her back,” said
Dorothy’s mother. But really Mother had
very little hope.</p>

<p>“There are so many junk men, and they
all seem to look alike,” she told Dorothy’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
father. “I don’t believe Patrick will find
the one to whom he sold the bag of rags
with the Sawdust Doll in it.”</p>

<p>But Dorothy kept on hoping, and every
time the bell rang she ran to the door, expecting
it was her Doll come back. But
night came, and the Sawdust Doll was still
missing. Dorothy cried herself to sleep.</p>

<p>At last morning came, and Patrick, going
out to sweep off a light snow that had
fallen in the night, saw a junk wagon stopping
in front of the house.</p>

<p>“Ha, there he is! There’s the man
I sold the Sawdust Doll to!” cried the
gardener. “There’s the junk man!”</p>

<p>The junk man got down off his seat and
started up the path with something in his
hand.</p>

<p>“Did you find——” began Patrick.</p>

<p>“I bring her back!” broke in the rag-buyer.
“My little girl, Tinka, found a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
Sawdust Doll in the rags when she sorted
them. I bring her back—the Doll.”</p>

<p>“Well, thank goodness!” cried Patrick.
“Dorothy will be glad of this! Wait a
minute, junk man!” he called back as he
ran into the house.</p>

<p>When Dorothy saw her Sawdust Doll
the little girl clapped her hands in joy
and cried:</p>

<p>“There she is! There she is! My Sawdust
Doll has come back, and with her
same rosy silk dress. I don’t care if it
has an ice-cream stain on it! I love
her!”</p>

<p>“Did the junk man bring the Doll
back?” asked Dorothy’s mother, as the
little girl held her toy in her arms.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Patrick. “He’s outside
now.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see him,” said Dorothy’s mother.</p>

<p>When she heard how Tinka had found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
the Doll in the rags, and how she had
wanted to keep the toy for herself, Dorothy’s
mother said:</p>

<p>“I think Dorothy will want to send Tinka
a doll. Not the Sawdust Doll, for that
is a birthday present. But I’ll find a doll
for Tinka if you will take it to her. You
will, please?” and she smiled at the junk
man, who smiled and nodded in return.</p>

<p>When she was told about the junk man’s
little girl, Dorothy picked out one of her
best dolls—the one Santa Claus had
brought her the Christmas before—and
took it out to the junk man.</p>

<p>“That is for Tinka,” said Dorothy.
“Please give it to her.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Tinka will be happy!” said the
man. “She will thank you a thousand
times!”</p>

<p>And when the junk man went home that
night with a doll that Tinka could keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
for her very own, the little girl, as she
helped her father sort the rags, said:</p>

<p>“Oh, how happy I am! Now I have
some one I can sing to sleep!”</p>

<p>And she crooned a soft little lullaby to
her own doll.</p>

<p>And Dorothy had her Sawdust Doll
back again.</p>

<p>“And I’m never going to lay you down
in a bundle of rags again, not even to bake
a strawberry shortcake!” she said. “Oh,
how happy I am!”</p>

<p>One day Dorothy’s mother said to her:</p>

<p>“I am going shopping again. Do you
want to come?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. And may I take my Sawdust
Doll?” asked the little girl. Her mother
said she might, and they set off.</p>

<p>By this time Dorothy, with the help of
Martha, the maid, had made a new blue
dress for the Sawdust Doll. It was of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
muslin, and would wash, so that even if
ice cream dropped on it not much harm
would be done.</p>

<p>“Are you going to get me the White
Rocking Horse?” asked Dorothy’s brother,
when he saw his mother and sister going
out shopping.</p>

<p>“I’ll see,” was all the answer given him,
but, somehow, because of the way his
mother smiled, Dick felt happy.</p>

<p>So Dorothy and her mother went back
to the same store where the Sawdust Doll
had been purchased. Up they went in the
elevator to the toy department.</p>

<p>And there the Sawdust Doll saw her old
friends. There stood the Lamb on Wheels,
as woolly and kinky as ever. And the
Bold Tin Soldier, at the head of his men,
was ready to drive away any rats that
might scurry out of their holes. The Calico
Clown almost seemed to be whispering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
to the Monkey on a Stick, and the Candy
Rabbit was looking down at the White
Rocking Horse.</p>

<p>“Oh, everything is just as I left it!”
thought the Sawdust Doll. “How I wish
I could talk to my friends! But we dare
not speak or move by ourselves as long as
any one is watching. However, I am
happy just to visit my friends again!”</p>

<p>And as Dorothy held the Sawdust Doll
in her arms, and as Mother looked about
the store, suddenly a loud noise sounded
off to one side of the toy department.
There was some shouting, and Dorothy
dropped her doll on the floor and ran, with
her mother, to see what was the matter.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<span class="small">“OH, DEAR ME!”</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Dorothy hurried away with her
mother to see what all the noise and shouting
was about, the little girl, as I told you,
dropped her Sawdust Doll on the floor.
But, luckily, the Doll fell on a footstool
that had been left near the White Rocking
Horse so little boys would find it easy to
climb up on his back. The stool was soft,
and the Sawdust Doll was not hurt in the
least, though a bit shaken up.</p>

<p>And as Dorothy and her mother hurried
out of the toy department, so did the other
shoppers and the clerks, so that the place
was left all to itself for a few minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“Oh, now we have a chance to talk!”
exclaimed the Monkey on a Stick. “Dear
Sawdust Doll, how glad we all are to see
you again! Tell us where you have been
and what has happened to you. Have you
had any adventures?”</p>

<p>“Adventures!” exclaimed the Sawdust
Doll, as she sat up on the footstool, for
there were no prying eyes to watch the
toys now, and they could do as they
pleased. “Adventures? I should say I
have had them! It has been nothing but
adventures since I left here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, tell us about them!” begged the
Calico Clown. “Were they funny ones?”</p>

<p>“Some were, and some were not,” answered
the Sawdust Doll, and she told
everything that had happened to her from
the time she left the store until she had
come back on this visit.</p>

<p>“Just fancy!” cried the Bold Tin Soldier.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
“Being in a junk shop! If I had
been there I would have cut a way for you
out of the bag with my sword!” he said.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the Sawdust Doll.
“But, after all, everything came out all
right as it was. I am back with Dorothy
again, and happy.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what all the excitement is
about,” said the White Rocking Horse,
as he rocked to and fro.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s just a man doing some magical
tricks to amuse the children,” said the
Monkey on a Stick. “I can see him from
here. He comes every year at Christmas
time to make it jolly for the children.”</p>

<p>“Now tell me some news!” begged the
Sawdust Doll. “What has happened here
since I went away?” and she softly patted
the wool of the Lamb on Wheels. “Have
you had any adventures?”</p>

<p>“Not many,” answered the Calico<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
Clown. “We have just been waiting for
some one to buy us and take us away, as
you were taken away.”</p>

<p>“I was almost sold yesterday,” said the
White Rocking Horse. “But the boy who
got on my back to try me kicked me with
his heels and scratched some of my paint.
I was glad when his father said he guessed
he would buy the boy a bicycle instead of
me. I wouldn’t want that kind of master—one
who would kick you with his heels.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” said the Sawdust Doll.
“My Dorothy is as kind as she can be.”</p>

<p>“I have thought up a new joke since
you went away,” cried the Calico Clown.
“It’s a riddle. Why does a bean bag——”</p>

<p>“Hush!” suddenly called the White
Rocking Horse. “To your places, every
one! Here come the People!”</p>

<p>And as Dorothy and her mother returned
from having gone to see the magician<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
take things out of a hat, the Sawdust
Doll and the other toys were as quiet and
motionless as if they had never moved or
spoken.</p>

<p>“Oh, look, Mother!” cried Dorothy. “I
dropped my Sawdust Doll on this cushion
and she’s right here yet!”</p>

<p>Dorothy held her Sawdust Doll in her
arms, and the little girl never knew of the
happy little visit her play toy had had with
the old friends.</p>

<p>“How much is this White Rocking
Horse?” asked Dorothy’s mother of the
clerk behind the counter. And when she
had been told the price Mother smiled and
said: “I must send Daddy to look at it.
This is just the kind Dick wants.”</p>

<p class="caption">Dorothy’s Father Fixes the Sawdust Doll<br>

<span class="illoright2"><i>Page <a href="#Page_118">118</a></i></span></p>

<p>When the shopping was finished the
little girl went down in the elevator with
her mother. The Calico Clown and the
Bold Tin Soldier, as well as the other toys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
wished they might call out a “good-bye” to
the Sawdust Doll as they saw her being
carried away. And they wished they
might tell her to come again. But they did
not dare, with all the people around.</p>

<p>One day when it was snowing so hard
that Dorothy and her brother could not go
out to play, Dick climbed into a rocking
chair in the middle of the playroom floor.</p>

<p>“I’m going to make believe this is a
rocking horse,” he said. “I’m going to
take a long ride,” and he swayed to and
fro. “Do you want to ride with me, Dorothy?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Thank you, no. I am going to make
a new dress for my Sawdust Doll,” was
the answer. “I’ll leave her here a minute
till I get some thread.”</p>

<p>Dorothy, leaving her doll down on the
floor, went to the sewing-room, where her
mother and Martha, the maid, were busy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
Dick began to sway backward, and forward
in the rocking chair.</p>

<p>“Gid-dap!” cried the boy. “Go fast,
Rocking Horse!”</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, the chair swung
to one side and one of the rockers went
right over the Sawdust Doll. It tore a
hole in her back and the sawdust began to
run out.</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” cried Dick, when he saw the
accident. “Oh, what will Dorothy say?
Oh, I’m sorry!”</p>

<p>He got down off the chair and looked at
the Doll on the floor. A little stream
of sawdust was running out over the
carpet.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” cried Dorothy, when
she came back and saw what had happened.
“Oh, dear me! Oh, Mother! Dick
has run over my Sawdust Doll and she’s
bleeding! Oh, dear me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>She picked up her toy. The sawdust
kept on running out, and the doll became
very limp in Dorothy’s hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, my Sawdust Doll has fainted!”
she cried. “What shall I do?”</p>

<p>Mother came running in to see what the
matter was. And, noticing the sawdust
running out of the Doll, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Hold your hand over the hole, Dorothy!
That will keep the sawdust in!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but my doll is spoiled!” sobbed the
little girl. “What made you run over her,
Dick, with your rocking-chair horse?”</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t mean to,” said Brother
Dick. “I’m sorry!”</p>

<p>“Oh, my Sawdust Doll will die!” cried
Dorothy.</p>

<p>But Daddy came in just then, and when
he saw what the trouble was he said:</p>

<p>“We’ll fix your doll, Dorothy. Don’t
cry. We can make her well again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“How?” asked the little girl.</p>

<p>“I’ll get some new sawdust for her from
the carpenter shop around the corner,”
was the answer. “You get a needle and
thread, Mother, and I’ll go after the sawdust.”</p>

<p>Dorothy dried her tears and watched
while her mother got ready a needle, with
a long thread, and her thimble. By that
time Daddy had come back with something
in a bag.</p>

<p>“Here is plenty of sawdust for the doll
that fainted, Dorothy,” he said with a
jolly laugh.</p>

<p>Through the hole made in the cloth by
the rocking chair, the new sawdust from
the carpenter shop was stuffed into the
Doll. Then Mother sewed her up.</p>

<p>“And I’ll give you a ride on my make-believe
rocking horse,” said Dick. “Come
on, Dorothy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“All right,” answered the little girl.
“I’ll wait until to-morrow about making
Dollie another dress.”</p>

<p>She climbed up into the chair with her
brother, holding her toy in her arms.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” thought the Sawdust Doll,
“my adventures seem to keep up. Just
fancy <i>fainting</i> because of an accident!
How I should like to tell the Calico Clown
and the Bold Tin Soldier about it. I
don’t believe either of them ever fainted
away.”</p>

<p>And as Dick and Dorothy and the Sawdust
Doll rode on the rocking-chair horse,
the little boy asked his father:</p>

<p>“Do you think, Daddy, I’ll ever have a
<i>real</i> rocking horse?”</p>

<p>“Well, I shouldn’t be surprised if you
did,” was the answer. “What kind would
you like?”</p>

<p>“A white one,” the boy answered. “Just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
like the one I saw in the store where Dorothy’s
Sawdust Doll was bought.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” promised Daddy.</p>

<p>And whether the little boy got his wish
you may find out in the book that comes
after this. It is called “The Story of a
White Rocking Horse,” and it tells about
the many adventures he had.</p>

<p>As for the Sawdust Doll, she lived with
Dorothy for a number of years, and you
may be sure many things happened to her—more
than I have room to tell of in this
book.</p>

<p>So I will say good-bye now, but I
shouldn’t be a bit surprised if you heard
something more about the Sawdust Doll,
as well as about the White Rocking Horse.</p>

Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the

goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
